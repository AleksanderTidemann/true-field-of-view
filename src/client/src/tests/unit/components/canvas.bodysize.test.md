// load specific canvasData,
// load specific body(s) as currBody,
// load a specific canvas width,

// check that the size (width in pixels) of the planets are all correct.

// move the calucations in drawCanvasBody to the calc file. aaaand maybe store the imagePxDiameter somewhere else.
// maybe do it in the store? Not the relative size (as we calculate in drawCanvasBody), but the absolute pixel width.
