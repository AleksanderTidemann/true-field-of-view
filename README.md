TFOV is a web application for calculating and visualizing the current true field-of-view (TFOV) of celestial objects based on different astronomy setups (telescopes, cameras, and eyepieces). Get valuable information about the precise angular and visual diameter of dedicated celestial objects (and their respective astronomical units), choose different visualization options, check tonight's local weather forecast, select presets off the shelf, and much more.
